//! Snapshot transfer state machines: one chunk in flight, ack-paced.
//!
//! The SENDER answers `RaftEvent::SnapshotNeeded`: it captures a
//! consistent descriptor (applied index/term/membership + the ledger
//! `(root, version)` at the same instant), pins the ledger version
//! against pruning, and streams path-ordered leaf chunks — each next
//! chunk only after the previous ack. The RECEIVER accumulates into a
//! [`SnapshotBuilder`], and on the final chunk finalizes (verifying
//! the advertised root), hands the restored store to the driver for
//! install, and acks `done`, which resumes ordinary appends.
//!
//! Crash mid-transfer is safe on both sides: the sender just unpins
//! and the pause re-signals; the receiver's clobbered ledger recovers
//! by repair-by-replay of its (still intact) local log, after which
//! the leader re-detects the lag and restarts the transfer.
