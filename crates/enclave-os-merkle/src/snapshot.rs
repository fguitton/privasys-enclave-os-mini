//! Snapshot restore: rebuild a store from streamed `(path, value)`
//! leaves, verify it lands on the advertised root, and stamp it at the
//! advertised version.
//!
//! The serving peer iterates its tree with
//! [`MerkleStore::snapshot_leaves`] and ships plaintext values over the
//! mutual-TLS peer link; the receiver re-encrypts under its OWN storage
//! key while the shared commitment key makes the rebuilt root equal the
//! advertised one — cross-key state transfer with end-to-end
//! verification, no shared storage keys ever.
//!
//! v1 applies the whole leaf set as ONE commit (transfer is chunked,
//! apply is not), so peak memory is proportional to store size; chunked
//! application with version offsetting is a later optimisation.
